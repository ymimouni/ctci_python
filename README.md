My solutions to [Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/).

This book covers 189 programming interview questions, ranging from the basics to the trickiest algorithm problems.

These solutions date back to 2020. I used unittest. Pytest is more pythonic.

I'll be commiting one chapter every day.
